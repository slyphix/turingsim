## JavaScript Turing Machine Simulator (v4)

[Visit the current version here!](https://slyphix.github.io/turingsim/)

[Visit the previous version (v3) here!](https://slyphix.github.io/turingsim-archive/v3/)

Simulates a freely programmable Turing Machine for use in education.

The fourth and final installment in my series of TM simulators includes every feature that I felt was missing from the previous versions.
Some of these features cannot be found in competing simulators.

This simulator is fully backwards compatible, but also includes the following additions:

- support for multi-tape and multi-head programs
- navigable tapes
- accepting states
- configurable syntax
- linkable and shareable programs
- built-in examples
- dynamically scaling user interface
- fast and non-blocking simulation via WebWorkers
- unrestricted offline experience
- installable as a Progressive Web App

For more details, consult the [built-in documentation](https://slyphix.github.io/turingsim/?help=y).

Also, if you are interested in the evolution of the simulator, feel free to check out the [TM simulator archive](https://github.com/slyphix/turingsim-archive)!
